inserting and editing
 1. double clicks will bring up the living/item dialog
 2. only one living per tile for now
 3. dragging will move livings, but not items and is meaningless to tiles

<strike comment="this was solved with uniqueness checkboxes.">
insert problems
 1. there can only be one living named joe... replace(joe=>($x,$y))
 2. there can be one billion arrows replace()? what?
</strike>

saving 
 1. need to give mapqueues a way to save xml, which will simply call the
    mapgen exporter and then add items ex post facto, maybe.
    kindof a shitty problem...

    Maybe it's better to each the xml_exporter about {item} and {living}s
    in the node?
